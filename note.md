ASUS Motherboards

-Advanced mode (F7) ->
[x] Under "Boot" -> set "4G Decode" to ENABLED.
[x] Under "Boot" -> set FAST BOOT to DISABLED.
[x] Under "Advanced" -> Onboard Devices Configuration -> set HD AUDIO CONTROLLER to DISABLED.
[-] Under "Advanced" -> PCH Configuration -> set PCI-E Link Speed to GEN2.

Note: Kept PCI-E Link Speed to AUTO ok at least for 5 GPUs.

Note: Some users have reported GEN1 working better with the ASUS PRIME Z270P. Try that if you have that board.
